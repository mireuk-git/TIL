```SQL
SELECT YEAR(SALES_DATE) AS YEAR, MONTH(SALES_DATE) AS MONTH, COUNT(DISTINCT U.USER_ID) AS PURCHASED_USERS, 
ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT S.USER_ID)/(SELECT COUNT(USER_ID) FROM USER_INFO WHERE YEAR(JOINED)=2021),1) AS PURCHASED_RATIO
FROM USER_INFO U JOIN ONLINE_SALE S ON U.USER_ID = S.USER_ID
WHERE YEAR(JOINED)=2021
GROUP BY YEAR, MONTH
ORDER BY YEAR, MONTH
```
- DISTINCT 때문에 좀 헤멘 문제
- 출력하라는게 복잡해서 문제지 구현에 어려움은 없다
